# Simple Quiz App

A minimal single-page quiz app containing festival questions (including "Which festival is called the festival of lights?").

How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use "Open with" -> your browser).

Files

- `index.html` — The quiz page.
- `style.css` — Minimal styles.
- `script.js` — Quiz logic and questions.

Notes

This is intentionally lightweight — no build step or server required. If you'd like a hosted demo, tests, or a React/TypeScript version, tell me which and I'll add it.
